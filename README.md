# Pokedex

## Description

This is the fifth guided project on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/).

The following is excerpted from the [course introduction](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli).

> A REPL, or Read-Eval-Print Loop, is a simple interactive programming environment that takes user input, evaluates it, and returns the result to the user. In this guided project, you'll build a Pokedex-like REPL in Go that uses the PokeAPI to fetch data about Pokemon. It's a great way to put your Go knowledge to the test and learn valuable skills like HTTP networking and data serialization.
