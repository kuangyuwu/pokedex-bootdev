# Pokedex

## Description

This is the fifth guided project on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/).

The following is excerpted from the [course introduction](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli).

> In this guided project you'll practice building a RESTful API in Go, and you'll use production-ready database tools like PostgreSQL, SQLc, Goose, and pgAdmin. This won't just be another CRUD app, but a service that has a long-running service worker that reaches out over the internet to fetch data from remote locations.
